## About The Project

![Tweepy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32036535/87276097-dd011780-c49c-11ea-980f-6b27e617faad.png)

In this project, 

We will learn how to create our OWN CLEANED DATASET to be used in a sentiment analysis.

* First, we will scrape data from Twitter with a keyword that we'd like to analyze using **"Tweepy"**.

* After retrieving the data from Twitter, we will go through a comprehensive cleaning process to better train our models later on.

* Then, we will create a csv file from the data to be used later as a dataset.



## Getting Started

This Jupyter Notebook was written in Python. You can directly download the notebook and run it locally, or you can upload it on Google Collabs and run there (I recommend GPU usage for faster training time). <br />
OR  <br />
**[Recommended]** You can go to [my Kaggle profile](https://www.kaggle.com/mustafaalgun/create-your-own-dataset-from-twitter) and easily copy & edit it. 
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.



### Installation

Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mustafaAlgun/Create-Your-Own-Cleaned-Dataset-From-Twitter-NLP-Sentiment-Analysis.git
```

## Usage

This is a walk-through Jupyter Notebook. Therefore, following the steps and reading comments will be more than enough for you to replicate the results :) Mind you, you need to change the credentials for Twitter API with your own! Here are some screenshots from the code & results.
